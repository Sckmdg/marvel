# Issues that i faced

- When you create an account in https://developer.marvel.com you're able to browse, but you will get 500 if you try to open docs page or try to generate a public key
    - i've tried to create a couple of accounts with VPN and different country, still didn't work
    - so i've to use incognito mode just to read docs
- Anyway i will try to use key that you provided, but it may take more time since i'm doing requests blindly
